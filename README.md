- 👋 Hi, I’m @svlib Sierra
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my knowledge of various programming languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more intricate knowledge of Java to expand my abilities using the language. I am also working on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on very little right now due to real life priorities that take precedence, but I am open to the idea of collaborating on projects concerning these languages. 
- 📫 How to reach me via email through the form on my site: https://sierralibertini.com
